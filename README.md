The original github repository is at 

https://github.com/hpssjellis/spark-core-web-page-html-control

but it was getting a bit bloated so I stated tyhis new one. Some useful pages may still be used from the original repo. One page that comes to mind is xtra-html-ajax-json-slider-polling.html at github

https://github.com/hpssjellis/spark-core-web-page-html-control/blob/master/xtra-html-ajax-json-slider-polling.html
